    Autocorrelation is the correlation of a variable with a lagged version of itself.
    Spikes in autocorrelation suggest seasonality.  For example, a spike in ACF at lag 24 hours
    would suggest daily seasonality
    Partial autocorrelation measures the degree of association between the variable and a lagged version of itself,
    controlling for the values of the time series at all shorter lags.
    The use of this function was introduced as part of the Boxâ€“Jenkins approach to time series modelling,
    whereby plotting the partial autocorrelative functions one could determine the appropriate lags p in an AR (p) model
    or in an extended ARIMA (p,d,q) model.
